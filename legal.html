						<h5>• PLEASE READ THESE CUSTOMER TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.</h5>
						<p>This is a contract between you (the Customer) and us (PlatformCore). It describes the services we will provide to you, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business relationship. It is a legal document so some of the language is necessarily “legalese”, but we have tried to make it as readable as possible. These terms are so important that we cannot provide our products and services to you unless you agree to them. By using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services, you are agreeing to these terms.</p>
						<p>We periodically update these terms. If you have an active PlatformCore subscription, we will let you know when we do via an email or in-app notification. You can find archived versions of the terms here.</p>
						<p>Finally, we know legal terms can sometimes be difficult to navigate, so we wanted to give you a roadmap of the Agreement:</p>
						<p><b>A. DEFINITIONS</b> This is where we provide the detail on what the key defined terms in the Agreement mean. You can think of this kind of like a contractual dictionary.</p>

						<p>For Consulting Services performed on-site, you will reimburse us our reasonable costs for all expenses incurred in connection with the Consulting Services. Any invoices or other requests for reimbursements will be due and payable within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice.</p>
						<p>If there are a specific number of hours included in the Consulting Services purchased, those hours will expire as indicated in the applicable description, which expiration period will commence upon purchase (the “Expiration Period”). If there are deliverables included in the Consulting Services purchased, it is estimated that those deliverables will be completed within the time period indicated as the delivery period in the applicable description, which delivery period will commence upon purchase (the “Delivery Period”). If there is no Expiration Period or Delivery Period indicated, then it will be one hundred and eighty (180) days from purchase. If the Consulting Services provided are not complete at the end of the Delivery Period due to your failure to make the necessary resources available to us or to perform your obligations, such Consulting Services will be deemed to be complete at the end of the Delivery Period. If the Consulting Services provided are not complete at the end of the Delivery Period due to our failure to make the necessary resources available to you or to perform our obligations, the Delivery Period will be extended to allow us to complete such Consulting Services.</p>
						<p>We might provide some or all elements of the Consulting Services through third party service providers. Consulting Services are non-cancellable and all fees for Consulting Services are non-refundable.</p>
						<!-- 5. Fees and Payments start -->
						<h2>5. Fees and Payments</h2>
						<p>a. Subscription Fees. The Subscription Fee will remain fixed during the Subscription Term unless you: (i) exceed your Maximum Contacts, Email Send Limit, User or other applicable limits (see the ‘Limits’ section below), (ii) upgrade products or base packages, (iii) subscribe to additional features or products, including additional Contacts, or (iv) unless otherwise agreed to in the Order.</p>
						<p>For our products that have applicable User limits, you will be charged fees associated with all Paid Users.</p>
						<p>b. Fee Adjustments in Next Billing Period. We determine the Contact tier for the next Billing Period by reviewing the number of Contacts in your account. For our Full-Service Marketing Products, we complete this review between forty (40) and twenty-five (25) days before the start of your next Billing Period. For our Marketing Hub Starter product, we complete this review on the last day of your Billing Period. If the number of Contacts in your account exceed your Maximum Contacts when we complete this review, then your Subscription Fee will increase at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the tier price which corresponds with the reviewed number of Contacts. Tier prices are as set forth in our Product and Services Catalog.</p>
						<p>We allow you to reasonably manage the number of Contacts during the course of a Billing Period and will not count Contacts removed before our review, unless these Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase. If Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase, we may consider the maximum number of Contacts from the reviewed Billing Period for the purposes of determining your Contact tier.</p>
						<h5>• This review and upgrade process will continue for each Billing Period during the Subscription Term.</h5>
						<p>c. Fee Adjustments During a Billing Period. For our Full-Service Marketing Hub Products, the Subscription Fee will increase during the course of a Billing Period if you exceed your Email Send Limit in a Billing Period. In this case, the Subscription Fee will increase to the tier price which corresponds with your maximum monthly email sends from the current Billing Period.</p>
						<p>For our Marketing Hub Starter product, if you reach your Email Send Limit, you will not be able to send any more emails until the start of the next calendar month, including emails pre-scheduled to go out after reaching the Email Send Limit. Kick-back emails from form conversion will not be interrupted. You may increase your Email Send Limit by purchasing additional Contacts, in which case your fee will increase during the course of a Billing Period.</p>
						<p>The Subscription Fee will increase during a Billing Period up to the corresponding base package and tier price (as set forth in our Product and Services Catalog) if you exceed the subdomains limit, add Paid Users, exceed other applicable limits (except as set forth in the ‘Fee Adjustments in Next Billing Period’ section), change or add products, or subscribe to additional features for use during the Billing Period. We may choose to decrease your fees upon written notice to you.</p>
						<p>d. Fee Adjustments at Renewal. For our Sales Hub and Service Hub products, upon renewal, your subscription will be adjusted to match the number of Users actually assigned at the end of your then-current Subscription Term, provided that, if you purchased a product with included Users, then you’ll continue to have those Users included even if they are not assigned. For our Marketing Hub Starter product, upon renewal, your subscription will be adjusted to match Contact tier that corresponds with the number of Contacts in your portal on the last day of your then-current Subscription Term. For more detail on renewal pricing, see the ‘Term and Renewal’ section below.</p>
						<p>e. Payment by credit card. If you are paying by credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account for all fees payable during the Subscription Term. You further authorize us to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party.</p>
						<p>f. Payment against invoice. If you are paying by invoice, we will invoice you no more than forty-five (45) days before the beginning of the Subscription Term and each subsequent Billing Period, and other times during the Subscription Term when fees are payable. All amounts invoiced are due and payable within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.</p>
						<p>g. Payment Information. You will keep your contact information, billing information and credit card information (where applicable) up to date. Changes may be made on your Billing Page within your PlatformCore account. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement. All fees are due and payable in advance throughout the Subscription Term. If you are a PlatformCore Agency Partner that purchases on behalf of a client, you agree to be responsible for the Order Form and to guarantee payment of all fees.</p>
						<p>h. Sales Tax. All fees are exclusive of taxes, which we will charge as applicable. You agree to pay any taxes applicable to your use of the Subscription Service and performance of Consulting Services. You shall have no liability for any taxes based upon our gross revenues or net income. If you are located in the European Union, all fees are exclusive of any VAT and you represent that you are registered for VAT purposes in your member state. At our request, you will provide us with the VAT registration number under which you are registered in your member state. If you are subject to GST, all fees are exclusive of GST. If you are required to deduct or withhold any tax, you must pay the amount deducted or withheld as required by law and pay us an additional amount so that we receive payment in full as if there were no deduction or withholding.</p>
